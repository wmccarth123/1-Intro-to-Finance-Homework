* Founded by Bobby Bao, Gary Or, Kris Marszalek, Rafael Melo

* Founded as a way to give every day users more control of their finances and data. This is exemplified in their mission statement “Our Mission is to empower users” and “accelerate the world’s transition to crypto currency” 

* Funded through an initial coin offering in May of 2017 rasing $26.7MM.

## Business Activities:

* Crypto.com (Website & Application) is an Crypto currency exchnage for everyday users. The platform is a one-stop shop for all currency transactions. 

* While the platform's services are geared toward everyday users, the app's interface is more advanced than its competitors. Thier more successful users have a working knowledge of crypto trading and experience using app exchanges. According to Yahoo finace, this marekt was valued at $1.49B in 2020 and is projected to reach $4.94B by 2020. 

* Crypto.com major advantages are: 1) a unique token (CRO) 2) Visa card that allows you to spend your crypto and earn rewards 3) Ability to earn interest on crypto holdings at a higher rate than the best high-yield savings accounts 4) Tax support available

* The company uses several technologies in order to ensure thier users have a quality customer experience and that thier information is safe. They implement blockchain technology accross thier currency offerings.  Amazon web servcies as both a partner on the site and cloud storage. The platform utalizes two-factor (2F) authentication, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance on USD balances, and insurance against damage or theft, and 100% in air-gapped cold storage. To keep thier users safe and technology safe. 


## Landscape:

* The company is in the Personal Finance/Online Banking & Cryptocurrencies domain

* Competing in two differet (yet converging) domains Crypto.com has taken advanagte of several industry trends over the past 5 years. In personal finace, the widespread adpotion of the smartphone and fast intert has enabled comapanies accross all industries to reach more customers. In the finacial industry banks/lenders/exchanges have enbraced the use of apps that allow the consumer to take ownership over thier personal finances. The company is also embracing the opprotunites that fiancial technology have opened to the traditioanl financial industry. By offering a cryptocurrencies exchange that everyday users can easily and afforably choose the platform is accelerating the addoption of cryptocury around the world.

* The major Cryptocurrency exchanges are: Coinbase.com Uphold.com Binance.com


## Results

* According to the company's website they currently have 2,600 employees, over 10 million users, across 90 countries. 

* As a private company Crypto.com is not obligated to report on the usual metrics of success for any firm. But these metrics are:
    * Revenues and profit
    * Value of CRO token 
    *  Number of customers/number of card holders

    * Staking amount for the cards

    * Depth and trading volume in the exchange

    * Volume of transfer on the blockchain

* The company is competing in a new dynamic market with rapidly changing external pressures. The previously listed competitor and Crypto.com are fighting for the attention and loyalty of a new group of consumers that are growing and changing with every new external pressure. 
    * In order to keep consumers attention the company has signed marketing & sponsorship deals with several US & European sports teams worth several hundreds of millions of dollars. 
    * This leads me to beleive that the company believes it can be the leading cosnumer platform for crypto curreny trading for years to come.


## Recommendations

* I would look to adpot some of the advanced offering that competitor give thier customers. These could include learning materials or RoboAdvisers

* As Crypto Currencies are more widley adpoted by everyday users customer will be looking for an all in one platform to both learn and trade. By adpoting RoboAdvisers and educational serivces the company will broaden thier customer reach.

* These services will use Algorithms & Machine Learningin order to learn and act on customer preferences.
